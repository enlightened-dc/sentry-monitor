Sentry Monitoring Screen

Download this repository. The ```index.php``` in the ```web/``` folder is the entry point. 
Configure the sentry monitor by coping the ```config.yml.dist``` to ```config.yml``` in the ```app``` folder.


You can generate the ```apiKey``` in your sentry application. The api key should have readable access for projects and events.
The url for the diagram is ```http://localhost/organisation-slug```. If the page is blank, check ```http://localhost/api/organisation-slug```.
